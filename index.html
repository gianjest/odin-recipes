    <p> Lasagna alla Bolognese is an institution, the baked lasagna par excellence, the signature Sunday dish. This rich and flavorful dish originated in Emilia and, specifically, in the city of Bologna. Baked lasagna, however, is known, appreciated, made and remade for the holidays and beyond, tasted and shared throughout Italy and abroad just as an iconic Italian dish. </p>
