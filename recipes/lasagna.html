    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5> FOR THE PASTRY:</h5>
    <ul> 
        <li> 3 eggs</li>
        <li> 350-400 g of 00 flour</li>
        <li> 400 g spinach, already cleaned and washed <br>(option, if you like that extra touch of flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5> FOR THE SAUCE</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> 150 g taut bacon</li>
        <li> 700 g mixed mince (pork loin and beef muscle)</li>
        <li> 90 g butter</li>
        <li> ½ glass of dry white wine</li>
        <li> 300 g of tomato sauce</li>
        <li> 1 celery </li>
        <li> 1 carrot</li>
        <li> 1 onion</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
        <li> coarse salt</li>
        <li> pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h5> FOR BÉCHAMEL </h5>
    <ul> 400mL of béchamel sauce</ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> Heat the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan on the stove, add the chopped onion and brown it gently, then add the chopped celery and carrot and brown them as well. Add the bacon and, after a minute, the ground meat. Sauté over a high flame, stirring continuously and deglazing with a spoon. When it changes color, add coarse salt and fresh mill pepper.</li>

        <li> Deglaze with the white wine, which you will let evaporate. Add the tomato puree and the two tablespoons of concentrate. Stir and bring to a boil, then cover and cook for about two hours over very low heat.  </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, transfer the spinach to a saucepan with a fingerful of water, salt it and cook it, lightly covered, until tender. Drain them, stop cooking under cold running water and squeeze them very well so that they do not release any residual water. Place them in the blender jar and chop them finely. Prepare the puff pastry: knead the ingredients by hand or with a planetary mixer until you obtain a homogeneous, smooth and elastic dough, which you will place inside a tightly closed plastic food bag. Let it rest for at least 1 hour at room temperature.</li>

        <li> Roll out the pastry with a rolling pin on the floured pastry board to a thickness that is not too thin and, with a sharp kitchen knife or pastry cutter, cut out rectangles that should be just slightly smaller than the size of the pan. Place a large saucepan full of water on the stove and bring it to a boil. Salt it and add a little oil. Then boil one rectangle of pasta at a time, turning it over; when it rises to the surface, transfer it, with the help of a skimmer, to the bowl with cold water, drain it and pat it well with a tea towel.  </li>
        <li> Arrange a first rectangle inside the baking dish so that it covers the bottom. Make a layer of béchamel sauce, making sure to reach well to the edges, and cover with meat sauce.</li>

        <li> Sprinkle with plenty of grated Parmesan cheese. Cover with another rectangle of dough and proceed in this way until you run out of ingredients. You will need to make 5-6 layers in all. Finish by covering everything with a final rectangle of dough, which will roast while cooking and become crispy</li>

        <li> Preheat the oven to 180°, ventilated mode. Before baking, portion the lasagna with a knife. Bake them for about 45 minutes, or at least until they have puffed up and are hot on the inside as well. Watch them frequently and, if they get too much color, cover them with aluminum foil. Discard the layer of pastry covering and gratinate for a few minutes under the grill. Remove from the oven, let it set for 5 minutes and serve your lasagna bolognese right away.</li>
