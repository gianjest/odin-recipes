        <li>Prepare the bisque: in a fairly large saucepan pour a drizzle of oil and wait until it becomes hot, then pour in the carapaces and toast them well. When they are nicely browned, deglaze with 500 g cold water and cook for 10 minutes. </li>

        <li>Once the bisque is ready, strain into a bowl or pitcher and set aside. Now cut the zucchini into crescents about 5 mm thick.</li>
        <li>Chop the shallots as well and cut the shrimp into ½ cm pieces. In a nonstick skillet, heat a drizzle of oil and pour in the shrimp</li>
        <li>Brown them for a few minutes, then remove and set aside. Stew, in the same pan in which you cooked the shrimp, the shallots as well. Then add the zucchini as well. When the zucchini are well browned, add the shrimp</li>

        <li>Turn off the flame. Season with salt and pepper. Pour a tablespoon of the bisque into a small bowl and dissolve the saffron powder in it. Cook the linguine in boiling salted water, holding the cooking time back 2-3 minutes. Drain in the pan with the sauce and finish cooking by adding the saffron mixture and bisque a little at a time as the pasta dries out </li>
