    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Saffron pistils (approx.) 0.25 g</li>
        <li>Carnaroli rice 320 g</li>
        <li>White wine 150 g</li>
        <li>White onions ½</li>
        <li>Butter 25 g</li>
        <li>Meat broth (boiling)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> For the creamy consistency</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>Butter (well chilled from the refrigerator) 120 g</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese DOP (to grate, well chilled from the refrigerator) 80 g</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare risotto alla milanese you will need to have ready about 1 lt of classic meat broth, which should always be kept very hot. Peel and finely chop half a white onion. In a large pan pour 25 g of butter, then the chopped onion. Wilt over medium heat, mixing occasionally to soften.</li>
        <li>Once browned, you can pour in the Carnaroli rice: the rice will absorb the butter and blend with the onion. When it is toasted and translucent, you can deglaze with the white wine. Let the alcohol part fade a few moments.</li>

        <li>Pour in very hot broth until covered and continue cooking over high heat, pouring in hot broth as needed. Gently soak the pistils in hot water, stirring just enough to revive them.</li>

        <li>At ¾ of the way through cooking, add the saffron pistils with the soaking water: wait a few moments for them to soften, then mix: they will release their fragrance and color. When one minute is left before the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat, add about 120 g of chopped butter, very cold from the refrigerator, and mix.

         <li>Pour in the grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP as well, stir vigorously so that the well-chilled butter and cheese create the heat shock that will promote creaminess and shine to the risotto. Serve the risotto alla milanese piping hot! Bon Appétit! </li>

         <li>We recommend consuming risotto alla milanese as soon as it is ready. <br>
            Should it be leftover, it can be stored for a day in the refrigerator; with the leftover risotto, you can then make crocchette, arancini or rice al salto.
